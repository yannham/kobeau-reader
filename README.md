# kobeau-reader

Simple, one-liner installer of KOReader on a Kobo device powered by Nix.

**Disclaimer**: I am not the original author of the script. It is taken from [A
mobile read thread](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=314220),
without attribution nor licensing. I use it myself to deploy new versions of
KOReader to my Kobo Forma and made it available as a flake, without having to go
to the forum thread and do things manually.

## Usage

TODO.
